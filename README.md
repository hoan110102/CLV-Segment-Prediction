# Introduction
Businesses today invest heavily in customers (acquisition costs, offline advertising, promotions, discounts, etc.) to generate revenue and generate profits. Of course, these actions make some customers valuable in terms of lifetime value, but there are always some customers who will reduce the profitability of the business. Identifying these behaviors, segmenting customers, and taking appropriate actions is essential for every business. This project will focus primarily on customer segmentation based on Customer Lifttime Value, thereby making appropriate recommendations for each customer group.
